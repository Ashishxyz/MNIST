### **Handwritten Digit Recognition with Real-Time Prediction via Tkinter Interface**

**Project Overview**
This project demonstrates a machine learning application that classifies handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained to recognize digits from 0 to 9, and a graphical user interface (GUI) is built using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library to enable real-time user interaction and prediction.

**Key Features**

* **Model Training**: Utilizes the MNIST dataset to train a robust CNN capable of achieving high accuracy in digit recognition.
* **Real-Time Prediction**: Users can draw digits on a canvas embedded in the Tkinter interface. The model predicts the digit instantly upon submission.
* **Interactive UI**: Built with Tkinter, the user interface offers a clean, intuitive design that allows users to draw, clear, and predict handwritten digits seamlessly.

**Technology Stack**

* **Frontend/UI**: Tkinter (Python GUI library)
* **Backend/Model**: TensorFlow / Keras (Convolutional Neural Network)
* **Dataset**: MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database)

**Functionality Workflow**

1. **Training**: The CNN model is trained on the MNIST dataset to learn digit patterns.
2. **Drawing Interface**: A Tkinter-based canvas allows users to draw digits using a mouse.
3. **Prediction**: The drawn digit is preprocessed and fed into the trained model.
4. **Display Result**: The predicted digit is shown in real-time within the UI.

**Use Cases**

* Educational tool for understanding neural networks and digit recognition.
* Prototype for digit-based form input automation.
* Foundation for more complex handwriting recognition systems.
